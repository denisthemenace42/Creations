Stuff that I create for personal use.

My first application that helps me achieve my goals for the day!
It helps you organize and manage your daily tasks. It greets you with a positive message, asks about your goals for the day, and guides you through the process of adding tasks and descriptions. With its encouraging messages and progress tracking, it keeps you motivated to accomplish your tasks. At the end of the day, it provides a summary of your achievements, displays the goals you set, and allows you to reflect on your day. It's like having a supportive friend by your side, cheering you on as you tackle your daily challenges."
